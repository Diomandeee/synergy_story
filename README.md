# synergy_story

This is a Python class named SynergisticPrompt which uses the OpenAI API and GPT-3 model to generate a story using a combination of brainstorming, metaphysical illumination, and convergent fusion techniques.

The __init__ method initializes the API key, GPT-3 model engine to use, and an initial prompt idea if available.

The generate_ideas method takes in a topic, colors, and textures to generate potential elements or themes for the scene. It uses the Non Linear Navigation brainstorming technique to generate the ideas.

The generate_questions method takes the generated ideas and uses Metaphysical Illumination to create thought-provoking questions related to the ideas.

The generate_prompts method uses Convergent Fusion to generate specific prompts that capture all aspects from the brainstorming and questions.

The generate_synergetic_prompt method combines the prompts generated in the previous step into a single prompt, which is then used to generate a story in the generate_story method.

The run method runs the entire SCPF prompt generation process, taking in a topic, colors, and textures and returning a generated story.
